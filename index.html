                    Hello world! My name is Austin Kang and I am a 22 year old student currently enrolled at UCI's
                    Coding Bootcamp.
                    For the past few years I have been searching for a career path that fits my best interests and
                    recently a friend of mine introduced me to coding.
                    It really caught my attention so I started going online and tried to learn it myself, but was only
                    able to get so far. That's when I found out about
                    the coding bootcamp and decided I wanted to enroll immediately. I'm hoping that after this 6 month
                    intensive my skills in coding have improved tremendously.
                    My goal is to land a job at a company as a web-developer. I'm super excited to be here and motivated
                    to learn!
                </p>
